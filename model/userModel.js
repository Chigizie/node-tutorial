  // üîê Why it‚Äôs still correct

  // When a new user signs up, this.password exists (it‚Äôs being saved), so pre('save') middleware and hashing work fine.

  // When logging in, you must fetch the password explicitly using .select('+password'). That‚Äôs why in the login controller we wrote:

  // if we didn't fetch the password explicitly using .select('+password'), we would set another databasePassword in the parameter to use and compare during login

  // using bcrypt to compare the password in database(databasePassword) and the on provided by who wants to login (inputPassword)

  // HOW BCRYPT.COMPARE WORKS

  // bcrypt.compare(plainTextPassword, hashedPassword);

  // First argument ‚Üí the raw/plaintext password (what the user typed at login).

  // Second argument ‚Üí the hashed password stored in the database.

  // In your code:
  // return await bcrypt.compare(databasePassword, inputPassword);

  return await bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, this.password);
